so git has three componenet, working directory, staging area  and HEAD is always the last commit?

✅ Exactly right — that’s the perfect foundation to understand Git deeply.
Let’s break it down clearly 👇

⚙️ Git has three main areas
Area	Description	Command to move changes	Example
1️⃣ Working Directory	Where you actually edit files. These are untracked or modified files on your filesystem.	git add <file> → moves to staging area	You modify app.java
2️⃣ Staging Area (Index)	A temporary area where you mark which changes should go into the next commit.	git commit → moves from staging to HEAD	You run git add app.java
3️⃣ HEAD (Repository)	Points to the latest commit in your current branch — what Git considers the "official" version of the project.	git reset or git checkout → moves changes from HEAD back	HEAD points to commit abc123
📍 HEAD explained

HEAD is a pointer to your current commit (usually the last one in the current branch).

When you make a new commit, HEAD moves to that new commit.

If you checkout another branch, HEAD moves to point to that branch’s last commit.

🧭 Think of HEAD as “Where I currently am in history.”
