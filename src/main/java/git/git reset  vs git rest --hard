so we did git add .

now we do git reset   ( which is git reset=mixed)
then files get unstaged...
whetever we had written stays intact



vs:
git reset --hard
=>it takes you to last commit
then everything (staging + working) would reset to last commit, meaning:

❌ All edits are gone — files restored to what they looked like in the last commit.
