how to take repo to particular commit state.. does git checkout commithashworks?

Excellent question — you’re thinking like a pro now 👏

Yes, you can absolutely move your repo to a particular commit state — and git checkout <commit-hash> (or the newer git switch --detach <commit-hash>) is one of the ways.
Let’s break it down properly 👇

🧭 Goal

You want your working directory and HEAD to reflect how the repo looked at a specific commit.

✅ Option 1: Temporary Move (Detached HEAD)
git checkout <commit-hash>
# or modern syntax:
git switch --detach <commit-hash>


🔹 What happens:

Git moves your HEAD directly to that commit (not to a branch).

You enter detached HEAD state — meaning, you’re not on any branch.

The files in your working directory now look exactly as they were at that commit.

💡 You can browse, build, test, or even create a new branch from this state.

🧩 Example:

git log --oneline
# shows
a1b2c3d Fix bug
d4e5f6g Add feature
f7g8h9i Initial commit

git checkout d4e5f6g
# HEAD is now detached at commit "Add feature"


Now your working directory looks like it did at that commit.

🔁 Option 2: Move Your Branch Pointer There Permanently

If you want your current branch (say main) to actually move back to that commit:

git reset --hard <commit-hash>


💥 Be careful:

This rewrites history.

Commits after that hash are deleted from your local branch.

Don’t use this on a branch that’s already pushed/shared.

🪄 Option 3: Create a New Branch From That Commit

If you want to explore that commit safely:

git checkout -b old_state <commit-hash>
# or
git switch -c old_state <commit-hash>


✅ Creates a new branch old_state pointing to that commit — no danger to main.

⚠️ Important: Detached HEAD

When you checkout a commit hash (not a branch), Git says something like:

Note: switching to 'd4e5f6g'.
You are in 'detached HEAD' state.


This means:

You’re no longer on a branch.

If you make commits now, they will be orphaned unless you create a new branch to keep them:

git checkout -b fix-old-state

🧠 Summary Table
Action	Command	Persistent?	Safe?	Notes
View past commit temporarily	git checkout <hash>	❌ Detached	✅	Just browse or inspect
Move branch back to that commit	git reset --hard <hash>	✅	⚠️ Dangerous	Deletes later commits
Create new branch from that commit	git checkout -b branchname <hash>	✅	✅ Safe	Keeps both histories

Would you like me to show this with a commit graph — showing HEAD, main, and detached HEAD arrows visually before and after checkout, reset, and branch? It’s a great mental model.
