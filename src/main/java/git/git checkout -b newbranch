when we create branch 2 from branch 1, and when we switch on branch 2, does branch 2 shows git logs of  branch 1 also.. meaning does it have the trail of how branch 1 was created


Short answer: Yes — when you create branch 2 from branch 1, branch 2 will show the Git log/history of branch 1 up to the point it was created.

🔍 Why?

A new branch in Git is not a copy of files — it's a pointer to a commit.

So when you run:

git checkout branch1
git checkout -b branch2


branch2 points to the same latest commit on branch1.

Therefore:

git log   # on branch2


will display all commits from branch1 up to the branching commit.

🧩 But what happens after branching?
Action	Branch 1 log	Branch 2 log
Before divergence	Same history	Same history
After commits on branch 1 only	Shows new commits	Does NOT show new commits
After commits on branch 2 only	Does NOT show those	Shows new commits

So the histories diverge after new commits.

💡 Does branch2 store how branch1 was created?

Indirectly, yes.

Git stores commit ancestry, not actual “branch creation metadata”.
Because branch2 starts at a commit that belonged to branch1, the commit chain inherently shows the trail.

Example commit graph:

A ── B ── C  ← branch1 HEAD (after 1 more commit)
         \
          D ── E  ← branch2 HEAD


Here:

branch2 was created at commit C

Git log of branch2 contains A → B → C → D → E

So you can see when it branched, by the point where commits diverge.

🧪 Quick command to visualize divergence
git log --graph --oneline --all

🔔 Final summary
Question	Answer
Does branch2 show history of branch1?	Yes, up to the branching commit
Does history automatically continue as branch1 evolves?	No
Does Git store “branch was created from X”?	Not explicitly — but commit ancestry shows it
