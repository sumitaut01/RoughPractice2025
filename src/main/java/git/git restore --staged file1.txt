Context — “git add” and staging area

When you run:
git add file.txt

You move file.txt from the working directory → staging area.
Now the file is staged for commit.

🧹 What git restore --staged does
git restore --staged file.txt


✅ This unstages the file — it removes it from the staging area and puts it back in the working directory,
but it keeps your file changes intact.

So after this command:

The file is no longer staged,

The file’s edits are still there on disk (not lost).
