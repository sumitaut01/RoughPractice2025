git reset and git revert both “undo” changes,
but they do it in very different ways — one rewrites history, the other creates new history.

Let’s break it down step-by-step 👇



Git Reset vs Git Revert
Both commands are used to undo changes, but they work very differently.

⭐ 1. Git Reset
📌 Changes the commit history

git reset moves the HEAD pointer and can remove commits from the current branch.

⚠️ Dangerous for shared repos
Because it rewrites history, others may lose commits.

Types:
🔹 Soft Reset
git reset --soft <commit>


Moves HEAD to the given commit
Keeps changes in staging area
Useful for redoing commits

🔹 Mixed Reset (default)
git reset <commit>


Moves HEAD
Removes commits
Moves changes to working directory

Not staged
🔹 Hard Reset
git reset --hard <commit>


Deletes commits
Deletes changes

Restores files to that commit
Cannot be undone easily

✔ Use When:
Changes not pushed yet
You want to rewrite or remove local commits

⭐ 2. Git Revert
📌 Does NOT modify history — creates a new commit
git revert adds a new commit that undoes the changes of an old commit.

👍 Safe for shared branches (remote)
Because history is preserved.

Example:
git revert <commit>

This creates a new commit like:
Revert "Some previous commit"

✔ Use When:
Change is already pushed to remote
You want to undo safely
You want to preserve history

⭐ Comparison Table
Feature	git reset	git revert
Changes history?	✔ Yes	❌ No (safe)
Removes commits?	✔ Yes	❌ No (adds new commit)
Safe for shared repo?	❌ No	✔ Yes
Types	soft, mixed, hard	single type
Best for	Local edits	Public branches
Can undo push?	No	Yes
Keeps commit history?	No	Yes
⭐ Simple Explanation
🔥 git reset

“Erase commits like they never happened.”
🍃 git revert

“Undo a commit but keep the history clean.”
⭐ Practical Example
Scenario 1: You committed by mistake locally

✔ Use:
git reset --soft HEAD~1

Scenario 2: You pushed a bad commit to GitHub
✔ Use:
git revert <commit>

Because revert won’t break others’ work.
⭐ Visual Understanding
RESET (rewrites history)
A - B - C - D   (current branch)
            ↑ HEAD
git reset --hard B
A - B        ← commits C and D vanish

REVERT (new opposite commit)
A - B - C - D - E   (current branch)
             ↑ bad commit
git revert D
A - B - C - D - E - R   (R = revert commit)

History is intact.
⭐ Interview-Friendly Answer (Short)
git reset rewrites history by moving HEAD to an earlier commit and discarding subsequent commits. It is unsafe for shared branches.
git revert creates a new commit that undoes a previous commit without modifying history. It is safe for public/shared repositories.
