What is git blame?

git blame is a Git command used to see who last modified each line of a file, along with:

Author name

Commit ID

Timestamp

The exact change

This helps you understand who wrote what in the code.

⭐ Why is it called “blame”?

Because it helps you “blame” (or identify 😅) the person responsible for a particular change.
But it's actually helpful, not negative.

⭐ Usage Example
git blame filename.java


Output example:

a9f1234 (John Doe   2024-01-15)  int total = 0;
12bdab3 (Jane Smith 2024-02-03)  total = total + price;


For each line, you get:

Commit hash (a9f1234)

Author (John Doe)

Date

Code line
