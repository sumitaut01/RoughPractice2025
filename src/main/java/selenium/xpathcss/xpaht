	driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[normalize-space()='100 Rows']")).click();
	(//a)[last()]
	//input[@id=’email’ or @type=’email’]

	//input[@id=’email’ and @type=’email’]

	//tagName[starts-with(@attributeName,’some text’)]

	//Wild Card
	//*[any xpath expression]
    //tagName[@*=’value’]

    //tagName[text()=’value’]
    //tagName[contains(text(),’value’)]


//Using position method:
  Position refers order.

  Note: when we write //input it will list all input nodes. When we write //input[2] it will not give you second input node from result of //input. It will give all input nodes which comes on 2nd position with respect to their parent node in DOM. Position should be positive and greater than zero.
    //input[position()=2]


Using attribute name:
If you want to if any web element has some attributes like id , name etc. or to know how many web elements have some attributes, we can use below expression.

Syntax:

//tagName[@AttributeName]

Example:

//a[@id]
   a[@id]



   ancestor: Selects all ancestors of current node.
   descendent: Selects all descenders of current node.
   following: Selects everything in the document after the closing tag of the current node
   following-sibling: Selects all siblings after the current node
   preceding: Selects all nodes that appear before the current node in the document, except ancestors, attribute nodes and namespace nodes
   preceding-sibling: Selects all siblings before the current node







   XPath Axes
   An axis represents a relationship to the context (current) node, and is used to locate nodes relative to that node on the tree.

   AxisName	Result
   ancestor	Selects all ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) of the current node
   ancestor-or-self	Selects all ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.) of the current node and the current node itself
   attribute	Selects all attributes of the current node
   child	Selects all children of the current node
   descendant	Selects all descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of the current node
   descendant-or-self	Selects all descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of the current node and the current node itself
   following	Selects everything in the document after the closing tag of the current node
   following-sibling	Selects all siblings after the current node
   namespace	Selects all namespace nodes of the current node
   parent	Selects the parent of the current node
   preceding	Selects all nodes that appear before the current node in the document, except ancestors, attribute nodes and namespace nodes
   preceding-sibling	Selects all siblings before the current node
   self	Selects the current node
