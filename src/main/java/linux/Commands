This is the list of some basic Linux commands which I would be using in this course.
Print the current working directory - pwd
List all the files & folders -  ls -al
Create directory  -  mkdir dirname
Change to directory  -  cd dirname
Create file - touch filename
Find files with the name - find / -name partialfilename
Remove file -  rm file
Remove directory - rm -r directory
I found the below list helpful. (source @reddit. )


tail -f -n 100 /var/log/syslog
✅ Shows the last 100 lines,

grep "ERROR" /var/log/syslog
✅ Shows only lines containing “ERROR”.

Example 1: Filter recent logs for a keyword
tail -n 100 /var/log/syslog | grep "ERROR"
👉 Shows the last 100 lines of the log file, filtered to only include lines with “ERROR”.

tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep "ERROR"
Follow logs and filter live
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep "ERROR"


👉 Live stream the log file,
👉 Only show lines containing “ERROR” as they appear.
