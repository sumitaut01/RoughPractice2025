Here is the cleanest, interview-ready answer for “What are the characteristics of REST API?”

Memorize this — it will impress interviewers.

✅ REST API – Key Characteristics
1. Client–Server Architecture

UI (client) and data/service (server) are separate.

Loose coupling → easy to scale, develop, and deploy.

2. Stateless

Each API request must contain all necessary information.

Server does not store client session.

Easy horizontal scaling and no session dependency.

3. Cacheable

Responses can be cached to improve performance.

HTTP headers control caching:

Cache-Control

ETag

Expires

4. Uniform Interface (Standard Methods)

REST depends on a consistent contract:

HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH

Standard status codes: 200, 201, 400, 404, 500

Media types: JSON, XML

Consistent resource naming: /users/101/orders

This makes APIs predictable.

5. Resource-Based (Not Action-Based)

Everything is treated as a resource.

Resources identified using URIs:

/employees

/employees/123

Think nouns, not verbs.

6. Layered System

Client doesn't know if it's talking to:

the main server

a load balancer

a proxy

a cache server

Abstraction improves security and scalability.

7. Representations

A resource can be represented in multiple formats:

JSON (most common)

XML

HTML

CSV

Client chooses via Accept header.

8. Code-on-Demand (Optional)

Server can send executables to client (rarely used).

Example: JavaScript snippet returned to a client app.

🧠 Super Short Interview Answer (30 seconds)

REST APIs follow client-server architecture, are stateless, cacheable, and use a uniform interface with standard HTTP methods and resource-based URIs. They support multiple representations, can be layered, and optionally support code-on-demand.

🎯 BONUS: If interviewer asks "Why REST?"

Answer:

REST is simple, scalable, stateless, uses standard HTTP, supports caching natively, and is easy for clients to consume.
