401 vs 403 different in restaasured api testing

Good question 👍 Let’s reframe it in Better Questions Checklist style so the answer is sharp:

✅ Goal

Understand the difference between 401 and 403 HTTP status codes in the context of API testing with RestAssured.

📌 Context

You’re working with RestAssured in Java for API testing.

Sometimes APIs return 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden when requests fail authentication/authorization.

You want to know what each means, how to simulate them, and how to validate in RestAssured.

🧪 Explanation
🔑 401 Unauthorized

Meaning: Client is not authenticated.

The server thinks you’re not logged in / didn’t provide valid credentials.

Example:

Missing Authorization header.

Invalid username/password.

Expired or malformed token.

In RestAssured, this often happens when you don’t set .auth().preemptive().basic(user, pass) or the bearer token is wrong.

given()
    .auth().none() // no auth
.when()
    .get("/secure/api")
.then()
    .statusCode(401);

🛑 403 Forbidden

Meaning: Client is authenticated but not authorized.

The server knows who you are, but says you don’t have permission for that resource.

Example:

A normal user tries to access an admin-only endpoint.

Valid token, but role/permissions don’t allow access.

given()
    .auth().oauth2(validUserToken) // authenticated user
.when()
    .get("/admin/api")
.then()
    .statusCode(403);

⚖️ Quick Difference
Code	When it happens	Analogy
401 Unauthorized	You haven’t logged in, or your login is invalid	Guard at the door: “Show me your ID first.”
403 Forbidden	You’re logged in, but not allowed inside	Guard at the door: “I see your ID, but you can’t enter this area.”
🛠️ In API Testing with RestAssured

Use 401 tests → to validate missing/invalid credentials handling.

Use 403 tests → to validate role-based access control.

Both should be part of negative testing scenarios.
