Here are super clear real-world examples of each — Uber API, SOAP service, and an internal Java API — exactly how to say it in an interview.

🚕 1. Real-World Example of a Web API (Uber / Ola / Swiggy API)
Uber API (REST API example)

When you open Uber and request a ride:

App calls GET /drivers/nearby

Server returns JSON with available drivers.

When you book a ride:

App calls POST /rides

Server creates the ride and returns ride ID.

When you track a ride:

App calls GET /rides/{id}/location

This is a REST API because:

JSON format

Uses HTTP verbs (GET/POST)

Stateless

Resource-based URIs

Real world analogy:
Your phone → asks Uber server for data → gets a JSON response → shows it on the app.

🏦 2. Real-World Example of a SOAP Web Service (Banking / Insurance / Government)
Example: Bank Fund Transfer SOAP Service

Banks and large enterprises still use SOAP because of strict security.

A SOAP request looks like:

<soap:Envelope>
  <soap:Body>
    <TransferFunds>
      <FromAccount>12345</FromAccount>
      <ToAccount>54321</ToAccount>
      <Amount>5000</Amount>
    </TransferFunds>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>


Every message goes through:

WSDL contract

WS-Security

XML schemas

Why SOAP?

Highly secure

Formal contract

Reliable delivery

Common in Core Banking, Insurance, Government systems (UIDAI, GST)

Real world analogy:
Bank web server only accepts properly formatted SOAP XML with strict validation.

🧩 3. Example of an Internal Java API (Not a Web Service)

This happens inside your application; no network used.

JDBC API (Internal Java API)
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, "user", "pwd");
PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM employee");
ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();


Why is this an API?

Provides a set of methods (rules) for your Java program to talk to the database driver.

No HTTP call

No network (unless DB itself is remote)

Another Internal API Example — Java Collections API
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names.add("John");


You call methods → Java handles implementation behind the scenes.

Real world analogy:
Your program uses built-in libraries — not a remote server.

🔥 Final Interview-Friendly Summary

Uber uses a REST API because mobile apps send JSON requests to web servers.
Banks use SOAP services because they need strict XML-based security.
Inside a Java application, APIs like JDBC or Collections allow modules to communicate without using a network.
