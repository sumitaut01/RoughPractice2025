how we will no if the api can be used for session filter or not.. in otherwords how to know if restful o rnot


Great question — and this is something many testers get confused about.

To know whether an API needs SessionFilter (i.e., uses sessions) or is truly RESTful (stateless), you must identify how the API handles authentication and state.

Here’s the breakdown.

⭐ How to Know Whether an API Needs SessionFilter?

You check how the API authenticates the user.

If the API uses session-based authentication, then you should use SessionFilter.

If the API uses token-based authentication, you don’t need SessionFilter.

⭐ 🔹 1. If the API returns a session cookie → Use SessionFilter

You can detect this by looking at:

Postman response cookies

Browser Network tab

API documentation

Response headers

If you see cookies like:
Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=ABCD1234;
Set-Cookie: SESSIONID=xyz789;
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=asdfgh1234;


➡️ This is a session-based API. Use SessionFilter.

Example:

When you call the login API, and the response contains:

Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=abcd123xyz; HttpOnly; Path=/;


This means the server expects you to maintain a session.
REST Assured does not store cookies automatically → SessionFilter is needed.

⭐ 🔹 2. If the API returns a token (JWT/OAuth/API key) → Do NOT use SessionFilter

If the response contains something like:

{
  "token": "eyGHSJSJH.897dasjjd.UHJDSGJ"
}


OR headers like:

Authorization: Bearer <token>


➡️ This means the API is stateless
➡️ No server-side session is maintained
➡️ This is real RESTful architecture
➡️ You should NOT use SessionFilter

Instead, send token on every request:

given()
    .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + token)

⭐ How to Know if an API Is RESTful (Stateless)?

A truly RESTful API will have these characteristics:

✔ 1. No session tracking

No JSESSIONID

No session cookie

No stored user state

✔ 2. Uses tokens

JWT

OAuth 2.0

API Keys

✔ 3. Each request contains all info needed

Server does not remember previous request

✔ 4. Stateless communication

Server doesn’t store user context

⭐ How to Identify This Practically?
🔹 Method 1: Use Postman → Check "Cookies" tab for the response

If you see cookies → session-based

🔹 Method 2: Look at Response Headers

Check for:

Set-Cookie
JSESSIONID
SESSIONID
PHPSESSID

🔹 Method 3: Check API Documentation

You may see terms like:

Session-based auth

Cookie auth

Form login

"Keep user logged in"

➡️ This is NOT RESTful.

🔹 Method 4: Browser Network Tab

If the app you test has a login, and you see cookies after login:
➡️ Backend uses session auth

🔹 Method 5: Developer confirmation

“Do we use cookie-based session authentication or token-based?”

⭐ Final Summary (Interview-Friendly Answer)

If the API returns session cookies (JSESSIONID, PHPSESSID, etc.), it uses session-based authentication.
In that case, we use SessionFilter to store and reuse the session.
If the API uses tokens (JWT/OAuth), it's stateless RESTful, so SessionFilter is not needed — we pass the token manually.
