Characteristics of a RESTful API

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style with specific rules.
An API is considered RESTful only if it follows these principles:

✅ 1. Stateless

Most important rule.
Server does not store client session or context.
Every request must contain all needed information.
The server treats every request as independent.

➡️ No session, no JSESSIONID, no server memory → pure REST
➡️ Uses JWT/OAuth tokens, not cookies.

✅ 2. Client–Server Separation
The client (frontend/UI) and server (backend/API) must be independent.
Client handles UI logic
Server handles data/business logic
Both can develop independently

✅ 3. Uniform Interface
REST API must use consistent patterns:
🔹 Resource-based URLs (nouns, not verbs)
✔ /users
✔ /users/10/orders

❌ /getUsers
❌ /createUser

🔹 HTTP methods follow CRUD:
Operation	HTTP Method
Create	POST
Read	GET
Update	PUT/PATCH
Delete	DELETE
🔹 Proper use of HTTP status codes

Examples:

200 (OK)
201 (Created)
400 (Bad Request)
401/403 (Authentication/Authorization)
404 (Not Found)
500 (Server error)
503(Service Unavailable)

✅ 4. Cacheable
REST should leverage caching for performance.
Server indicates if responses can be cached using headers:
Cache-Control: max-age=3600


Helps reduce load and speed up responses.
✅ 5. Layered System

The client should not know whether it's connected to:
Main server
Load balancer
Proxy
Authentication server
Architecture can have multiple layers, but the client sees it as one.

✅ 6. Resource Representation

Data is treated as resources, not actions.

Resources must be represented in a standard format, commonly:

JSON (most common)
XML
HTML
YAML

Example:

{
  "id": 10,
  "name": "John"
}

✅ 7. HATEOAS (Optional in modern APIs)

Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State — links inside JSON pointing to next possible actions.

Example:

{
  "user": 10,
  "name": "John",
  "links": [
     { "rel": "orders", "href": "/users/10/orders" }
  ]
}


Not strictly used in modern APIs, but part of REST theory.

⭐ Summary Table (Quick Revision)
Characteristic	Meaning
Stateless	No session stored, each request independent
Client–Server	Separation of UI & backend
Uniform Interface	Resource-based URLs + HTTP methods
Cacheable	Uses caching for performance
Layered system	Multiple layers allowed
Resource Representation	JSON/XML-based resources
HATEOAS	Links inside responses (optional)
⭐ How to identify a RESTful API?

If the API uses:
✔ Tokens instead of sessions
✔ Resource-based URLs
✔ Stateless communication
✔ Standard HTTP methods
✔ Standard HTTP response codes

➡️ Then it is RESTful
