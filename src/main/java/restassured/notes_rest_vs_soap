Here is the cleanest, interview-ready difference between REST & SOAP, short + crisp + clear.

✅ REST vs SOAP — Interview Version
1. Architecture

REST → Architectural style

SOAP → Strict protocol

2. Format

REST → Works with JSON, XML, HTML, CSV

SOAP → Only XML

3. Complexity

REST → Simple, lightweight

SOAP → Heavy, strict, formal

4. Communication

REST → Uses HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

SOAP → Uses service operations defined under WSDL

5. Data Transfer Style

REST → Resource-based (URI driven)

SOAP → Contract-based (WSDL driven)

6. Statefulness

REST → Stateless

SOAP → Can be stateful or stateless

7. Use Cases

REST → Web/mobile APIs, microservices

SOAP → Banking, payments, legacy enterprise (strict security)

8. Performance

REST → Fast (JSON, caching, lightweight)

SOAP → Slower (heavy XML, envelope)

9. Security

REST → Basic Auth, OAuth, JWT

SOAP → WS-Security (enterprise-level security)

10. Error Handling

REST → HTTP status codes

SOAP → SOAP Faults

⭐ Short 15-Second Interview Summary

REST is lightweight, flexible, uses JSON, and is ideal for modern web/mobile APIs.
SOAP is a strict XML-based protocol with high security & formal contracts, used mainly in enterprise or financial systems.
