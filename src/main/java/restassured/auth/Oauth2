Resource owner ‚Äì An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.
Resource server ‚Äì The server hosting the protected resources that is capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.
Client ‚Äì  An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization.
Authorization server ‚Äì The server issues access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.

BookMyShow Example (Google Sign-In with OAuth 2.0)
1. Resource Owner (You, the User)
You are the one who has the Google account (email, profile, etc.).
You own the resource (email, profile info, etc.) that BookMyShow needs access to.
You grant permission when Google asks:
‚ÄúBookMyShow wants to access your Google profile and email. Do you allow?‚Äù

2. Resource Server (Google APIs)
Google‚Äôs APIs (e.g., https://www.googleapis.com/userinfo/v2/me) hold your protected resources.
They only release your profile/email info if BookMyShow presents a valid Access Token.

3. Client (BookMyShow Application)
BookMyShow (mobile app / web app) is the client.
It wants your Google profile/email so it can log you in or create your account in BookMyShow.
BookMyShow doesn‚Äôt get your password directly. Instead, it gets an Access Token from Google (after you approve).

4. Authorization Server (Google OAuth Server)

Google‚Äôs OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server handles:
Authenticating you (checking your Google password / saved login).
Asking you for consent (whether BookMyShow can use your data).
Issuing an Authorization Code and then an Access Token to BookMyShow.

üîÑ Flow (Simplified)

You click ‚ÄúSign in with Google‚Äù on BookMyShow.

BookMyShow redirects you to Google‚Äôs Authorization Server (login + consent).

You approve ‚Üí Google sends back an Authorization Code to BookMyShow.

BookMyShow exchanges that code with Google for an Access Token.

BookMyShow uses the Access Token to call Google‚Äôs Resource Server and get your profile/email.

BookMyShow logs you in (or creates your account) using that info.

‚ö° Quick Mapping Table
OAuth Term	In BookMyShow + Google Sign-In
Resource Owner	You, the user with Google account
Resource Server	Google APIs (userinfo, gmail, etc.)
Client	BookMyShow app/website
Authorization Server	Google OAuth 2.0 endpoint (login + token issuing)

üëâ That‚Äôs why in your earlier RestAssured API tests, you often just pass the Authorization header with Bearer token ‚Üí because you‚Äôre simulating steps 4‚Äì6. The login & consent (steps 1‚Äì3) are usually handled once in browser or automated in test setup.
