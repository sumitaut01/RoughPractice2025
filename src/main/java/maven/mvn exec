what does this line imply mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="GuiceTest"
This command is used to execute a specific Java class within a Maven project environment. It relies on the Exec Maven Plugin, which allows you to run Java programs using the libraries and dependencies defined in your project's pom.xml.

Here is the breakdown of the command:

1. The Breakdown
mvn: This invokes the Maven build tool.

exec:java: This tells Maven to run the java goal of the exec plugin.

Plugin: exec-maven-plugin (This plugin allows you to execute system and Java programs).

Goal: java (This specific goal runs a Java class with the current project's classpath).

-D: This syntax is used to pass a system property or parameter to the plugin.

exec.mainClass="GuiceTest": This is the specific parameter telling the plugin which class contains the public static void main(String[] args) method you want to run.

In this case, it is trying to run a class named GuiceTest.

2. What actually happens when you run this?
Dependency Resolution: Maven looks at your pom.xml and downloads/verifies all the JARs (libraries) your project needs (e.g., Google Guice, JUnit, etc.).

Classpath Construction: Maven builds the classpath automatically, including your source code and all those downloaded libraries.

Why this is useful: You don't have to manually type java -cp library1.jar;library2.jar;... GuiceTest. Maven handles the classpath mess for you.

Execution: It locates the GuiceTest class and executes its main() method.

3. Important Note on Class Names
In your command, the class is listed simply as "GuiceTest".

If the class is in the default package: This command will work as written.

If the class is inside a package (e.g., com.example.GuiceTest): You must provide the fully qualified name. If GuiceTest.java is in the com.example package, the command must be: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.GuiceTest"
