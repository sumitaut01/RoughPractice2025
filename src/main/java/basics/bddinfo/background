Background with Hooks
This is so interesting to see the working of Background with Hooks. The background is run before each of your scenarios but after any of your @Before hook.

@Before: Print the starting logs
@Before: Start browser and Clear the cookies
@After:  Close the browser
@After: Print the closing logs
