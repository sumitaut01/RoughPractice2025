This is the list of some basic Linux commands which I would be using in this course.
Print the current working directory - pwd
List all the files & folders -  ls -al
Create directory  -  mkdir dirname
Change to directory  -  cd dirname
Create file - touch filename
Find files with the name - find / -name partialfilename
Remove file -  rm file
Remove directory - rm -r directory
I found the below list helpful. (source @reddit. )
