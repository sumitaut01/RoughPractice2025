its possible that we can use github actions and trigger aws grid url:

ðŸ”§ Step 1. Pre-requisites

Your AWS EC2 Selenium Grid is already up at http://<Elastic-IP>:4444/wd/hub.

Hub + Chrome node are running with docker-compose.

Port 4444 is open in the EC2 security group.

Your Selenium Test Project (Maven + TestNG/JUnit) is pushed to GitHub.

ðŸ”§ Step 2. Add GitHub Secret

Go to your GitHub repo â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets â†’ Actions â†’ New repository secret:

SELENIUM_GRID_URL â†’ http://<Elastic-IP>:4444/wd/hub

This way, your Grid URL is not hardcoded in the workflow.

ðŸ”§ Step 3. Update Your Code

In your driver setup, read the URL from environment variable:

String gridUrl = System.getenv("SELENIUM_GRID_URL");
WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(
    new URL(gridUrl),
    new ChromeOptions()
);



tep 4. Create GitHub Actions Workflow

In your repo, create:

.github/workflows/selenium-grid.yml


Paste this:

name: Run Selenium Tests on AWS Grid

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '17'

      - name: Cache Maven dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ~/.m2/repository
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-maven-

      - name: Run Selenium Tests
        env:
          SELENIUM_GRID_URL: ${{ secrets.SELENIUM_GRID_URL }}
        run: mvn clean test
