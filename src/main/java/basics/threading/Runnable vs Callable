Runnable and Callable are both used to define tasks for threads or thread pools in Java — but they have key differences.

🔥 Quick comparison
Feature	Runnable	Callable<V>
Returns a value	❌ No	✔️ Yes (V)
Can throw checked exception	❌ No	✔️ Yes
Method to implement	run()	call()
Future support	Indirect	Direct (via Future)
Introduced in	Java 1.0	Java 5
🧩 Runnable example
class MyTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running task");
    }
}


Usage:

Thread t = new Thread(new MyTask());
t.start();


Runnable.run():

cannot return a result

cannot throw a checked exception

If you want a result, you'd need to store it manually somewhere (e.g., shared variable), which can be unsafe.

🧩 Callable example
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;

class MyTask implements Callable<Integer> {
    @Override
    public Integer call() throws Exception {
        return 10;
    }
}


Used with ExecutorService:

ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
Future<Integer> future = service.submit(new MyTask());
Integer result = future.get(); // waits and returns 10


Here:

result comes from call()

future.get() waits for completion and retrieves return value

🎯 When to use what?
Use case	Interface to choose
Fire-and-forget task	Runnable
Task that needs to return result	Callable
Task that may throw checked exception	Callable
Using raw Thread	Runnable
Using ExecutorService thread pool	Callable is ideal, but Runnable also supported
🔥 In a nutshell
Runnable = do work
Callable = do work AND return something

Bonus: Runnable vs Callable with ExecutorService
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

// Runnable
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Hello"));  // no result

// Callable
Future<String> f = executor.submit(() -> "Hello from Callable");
System.out.println(f.get());  // prints: Hello from Callable
