Defect Slippage
Definition:
Defect slippage occurs when bugs escape QA testing and are found after release (UAT, Production).

Example:
QA tested login feature but missed a security bug → customer finds it after release.

✅ Defect Leakage
Definition:
Defect leakage happens when bugs escape from one testing phase to the next testing phase.
➡️ Slippage = escaped to PRODUCTION
➡️ Leakage = escaped to NEXT PHASE (e.g., Unit → Integration, QA → UAT)

Example:
Bug missed in System Testing, found in UAT = defect leakage.
⭐ Difference (Simple)
Term	Escaped To
Defect Leakage	Escapes to next test phase
Defect Slippage	Escapes to production


✅ Manual Testing Types
1️⃣ Black Box Testing

Tester doesn’t know internal code.
Examples: Functional testing, regression testing, system testing.

2️⃣ White Box Testing
Tester knows internal logic, paths.

3️⃣ Grey Box Testing
Partial internal knowledge.


Common Manual Functional Testing Types:
Type	Purpose
Smoke Testing	Quick check: “Is build stable?”
Sanity Testing	After fixes: “Does it work now?”
Regression Testing	Ensure old functionality still works
Re-testing	Verify bug fixes
Functional Testing	Test features as per requirements
Integration Testing	Test interactions between modules
System Testing	Complete system test
UAT Testing	User/business testing
Ad-hoc Testing	Informal, no documentation
🟦 Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
Definition:

Test boundaries of input ranges because bugs often occur at edges.

Example:

Age must be 18–60
Test: 17, 18, 60, 61

🟦 Equivalence Partitioning (EP)
Definition:
Divide input into valid and invalid partitions; test one input from each.

Example:
Age 18–60
Valid: 18–60 → test 30
Invalid partition 1: <18 → test 10
Invalid partition 2: >60 → test 70

🟦 Experience-Based Testing
Definition:
Testing based on tester’s experience, intuition, domain knowledge.

Examples:
Guessing where bugs usually occur
Prior failed modules

Risk areas

🟦 Ad-hoc Testing
Definition:

Informal, unstructured testing without test cases.
Used to quickly explore and find defects.

Example: Randomly trying combinations, invalid inputs, quick checks.

⭐ Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Techniques

RCA helps identify why the defect occurred.

Common RCA methods:
1️⃣ 5 Whys

Ask “Why?” repeatedly until you find the root cause.

2️⃣ Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)

Categorizes possible causes:
People
Process
Tools
Environment
Requirements

3️⃣ Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)
80% issues come from 20% causes.

4️⃣ Failure Mode & Effects Analysis (FMEA)
Analyze failure types → severity → detectability.

⭐ Definition of Done (DoD)
Definition:
A checklist of criteria that must be met before a task/user story is considered complete.

Example DoD:
Code completed
Unit tested
Functionally tested
Regression tested
Documentation updated
Accepted by PO

DoD ensures consistent quality across sprints.

⭐ Shift Left Testing
Definition:

Testing earlier in the SDLC to catch defects early.
Why?
Reduced cost
Faster delivery
Higher quality
Examples:

Testers involved in requirement discussions
Early test case creation
Early automation
API contract testing before UI is ready

📌 Summary Sheet (quick memory)

Test Case Design Techniques
Severity vs Priority
Bug/Defect Life Cycle

Let’s go step by step.

✅ 1. SDLC Models (Software Development Life Cycle)
⭐ 1. Waterfall Model

Linear, sequential
Each phase completed before next
Requirements need to be stable

➡️ Good: Simple, structured
➡️ Bad: No flexibility, late testing

⭐ 2. V-Model (Validation & Verification)

Testing activities happen in parallel to development phases

Test planning starts early

➡️ Good: Test early
➡️ Bad: Still rigid like waterfall

⭐ 3. Iterative / Incremental Model

Build software in pieces (increments)

Each build adds new functionality

➡️ Good: Early delivery
➡️ Bad: Requires good planning

⭐ 4. Agile Model (Most used today)
Iterative + incremental
Work in small cycles (sprints)
Continuous feedback & improvement

➡️ Good: Flexible, customer involvement
➡️ Bad: Needs strong communication

✅ 2. STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)
STLC Phases:

Requirement Analysis
Understand requirements
Identify testable items
Identify test types
Test Planning

Estimate effort

Resource planning

Risk analysis

Strategy preparation

Test Case Design
Create test cases
Prepare test data
Environment Setup
Get hardware/software ready

✅ 3. Agile & Scrum Concepts
⭐ Agile Principles

Early & continuous delivery
Welcome changes
Frequent delivery
Communication
Working software > documentation

⭐ Scrum Terminology
Term	Meaning
Product Owner (PO)	Defines requirements, sets priority
Scrum Master	Removes blockers, facilitator
Development Team	Dev + QA team
Sprint	1–4 week time-box
Sprint Planning	Decide sprint work
Daily Scrum	15-min stand-up meeting
Sprint Review	Show completed work
Sprint Retrospective	Improve process
⭐ Scrum Artifacts
Artifact	Meaning
Product Backlog	List of all requirements
Sprint Backlog	Tasks for the sprint
Increment	Completed + tested product
✅ 4. Test Case Design Techniques

You already saw BVA, EP, Adhoc, Experience-based.
Here are others:

⭐ 1. Decision Table Testing

Used when there are multiple conditions and multiple outcomes.

Example: Login with combinations of username/password valid/invalid.

⭐ 2. State Transition Testing

Used when output depends on previous state.

Example:

ATM: card inserted → PIN → withdraw

User states: Active → Locked → Disabled

⭐ 3. Use Case Testing

User-flow based testing.

⭐ 4. Error Guessing

Based on experience, guess where bugs may occur.

✅ 5. Severity vs Priority
Term	Meaning	Decided By
Severity	Impact of defect on system	Tester
Priority	Order in which defect must be fixed	Product Owner / Manager
⭐ Examples

App crashes → High severity

Typo on homepage → Low severity but may be High priority

✅ 6. Bug/Defect Life Cycle
Typical defect states:

New

Assigned

Open

Fixed

Retest

Verified

Closed

If not fixed:

Rejected

Top Manual Testing Interview Questions (with answers)

Let’s begin.

✅ 1. Testing Metrics (Very Important!)

Metrics help measure testing progress, quality, and effectiveness.

⭐ 1. Test Coverage

How much of the application is tested.

Formula:

Test Coverage = (Number of requirements tested / Total requirements) × 100

⭐ 2. Defect Density

Number of defects per size unit (module size, LOC, function points).

Formula:

Defect Density = Defects / Size

⭐ 3. Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE)

Measures how many defects were caught before release.

DRE = (Defects found during testing / Total defects) × 100

⭐ 4. Test Execution Metrics

Passed test cases

Failed test cases

Blocked test cases

Not executed test cases

⭐ 5. Defect Leakage %

Defects escaped to UAT or Production.

Leakage % = (Defects leaked / Total defects) × 100

✅ 2. Performance Testing Basics
⭐ Types of performance testing:
Type	Purpose
Load Testing	Check system behavior under expected load
Stress Testing	Push system beyond limits
Spike Testing	Sudden large increase in load

✅ 6. Top Manual Testing Interview Questions (with answers)
⭐ 1. What is the difference between verification and validation?

Verification: Are we building the product right?

Validation: Are we building the right product?

⭐ 2. What is the difference between functional and non-functional testing?

Functional: tests features, behavior

Non-functional: performance, security, usability

⭐ 3. What is sanity testing?

Sanity = Quick testing of a specific module after bug fixes.

⭐ 4. What is regression testing?

Testing to ensure new changes didn't break existing features.

⭐ 5. What are entry and exit criteria?

Entry criteria: what must be ready before testing starts

Exit criteria: what must be done before testing ends

⭐ 6. What would you do if the developer rejects your bug?

Provide logs, screenshots, steps
