Perfect timing! Generics are foundational in Java for writing type-safe, reusable, and readable code, especially in:

Collections (List<String>, Map<Integer, String>)

Custom classes and methods

Framework development

Let’s break this down step by step, starting simple and gradually going deeper.

✅ What Are Java Generics?
Generics allow you to parameterize types (just like methods can have parameters).
This means you can write code that works with any data type, while still being type-safe.

🧠 Basic Example: Without vs With Generics
❌ Without Generics

List list = new ArrayList();
list.add("Sumit");
list.add(100);  // No compile-time error!

String name = (String) list.get(0);  // Needs explicit cast
✅ With Generics
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Sumit");
// list.add(100); ❌ Compile-time error

String name = list.get(0); // ✅ No cast needed
✅ Why Use Generics?
Benefit	Description
Type Safety	Prevents runtime ClassCastException
Code Reusability	One class/method works for many types
Cleaner Code	No casting required
Compile-time Checking	Catch bugs early
